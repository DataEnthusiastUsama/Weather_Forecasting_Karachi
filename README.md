# Weather_Forecasting_Karachi
In this project, I harnessed data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Jinnah International Station to forecast Karachi's weather. Utilizing time series modeling and the walk-forward approach, I achieved an impressive RMSE of 1.5. This predictive model provides accurate current-day, tomorrow, and the day-after-tomorrow temperature forecasts.

Special thanks to my collaborator Ehsan for helping me making  an intuitive UI to enhance the viewer's experience. Explore and stay informed about Karachi's weather trends in real-time!"
